# User Guide for `vincario-charts-lib`

The following guide will help you integrate our `vincario-charts-lib` library into your website. This library allows you to easily embed various types of vehicle market value charts.

## Step 0: Download the library

Start by downloading the `vincario-charts-lib.js` file from dist/ folder. Once downloaded, ensure to include the `vincario-charts-lib.js` file into your project's directory.

## Step 1: Insert the script into your webpage

Next, insert the following script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag in your HTML file.

```html
<script src="*path*/vincario-charts-lib.js"></script>
```

Replace `*path*` with the path leading to the `vincario-charts-lib.js` script within your project.

## Step 2: Create the div structure for your charts

Then, create a `div` structure according to the types of charts you wish to display. You have the freedom to choose either one or both types of charts - vehicle price distribution and vehicle price map. Remove the unnecessary divs according to your requirements. For instance, to display both charts, you may use the following code:

```html
<div class="vincario-vehicle-market-value-charts" data-records="this-is-the-important-attribute">
  <div class="vehicle-price-distribution"></div> 
  <div class="vehicle-price-map"></div>
</div>
```

The important attribute to be filled according to your requirements is `data-records`.

## Step 3: Populate the data-records

The `data-records` attribute should be populated according to your needs. You need to fetch this data through our API. Look for more info at [https://vindecoder.eu/api/](https://vindecoder.eu/api/). It is a crucial attribute that dictates the data to be displayed on the charts. Please don¬¥t forget to put there JSON representation of response of our API.

## Step 4: Enjoy your charts!

That's it! You should now be able to see the charts on your webpage.
